			<h2>More about me</h2>
			<p>
				My journey into web development began in September 2022, while I was
				employed as a salesperson at a blockchain IT services company. This
				experience inspired me to delve deeper into the intricacies of the
				internet and web applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				To lay a solid foundation, I initially enrolled in a comprehensive
				full-stack web development course, which provided me with a holistic
				understanding of the field. However, I soon realized that I wanted to
				specialize, so I decided to focus intensively on React and JavaScript,
				committing over 150 hours to an advanced course.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this time Iâ€™m still focused in improving my skills, but, after all
				this work done, I now believe I can contribute effectively in the
				development of fully working web-apps, if collaborating with a senior
				developer.
